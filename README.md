# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Lab: Make an app with the Brewdog API

## Learning Objectives

- Be able to make API requests in a React app
- Be able to design a React component hierarchy
- Understand how to traverse the data structure received from an API
- Be able to implement React useState and useEffect hooks

Your task is to build an app that uses [this API](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2) to display information on a variety of beers.

[This endpoint](https://api.punkapi.com/v2/beers) will provide you with some data detailing multiple beers.

**It is important for this task you consider what your views will be, but also how you can reuse components to construct these different views.**

## MVP

Your app should be able to:

- Allow the user to view all the beers
- Allow the user to view more detailed information on a selected beer
- Allow the user to favourite beers
- Display the user's favourite beers

## Extensions

- Prevent the user from marking the same beer as a favourite more than once
- Allow the user to deselect favourite beers
- Display the selected beer's ingredients (without duplicates)
- The endpoint provided will only return 20 beers at a time. Modify your initial request to fetch all 300+ beers the API provides.
